    <para>Now we deal with conditional executions of test actions. Nested actions inside a conditional container are
    executed only in case a booleand expression evaluates to true. Otherwise the container execution is not performed at all.</para>
    
    <para>See some example to find out how it works with the conditional expression string.</para>
    
    <programlisting>&lt;testcase name=&quot;conditionalTest&quot;&gt;
    &lt;actions&gt;
        &lt;conditional expression=&quot;${value} = 5&quot;&gt;
            &lt;sleep time=&quot;10&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/conditional&gt;
    &lt;/actions&gt;
&lt;/testcase&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>The nested sleep action is executed in case the variable ${value} is equal to the value '5'. This conditional execution of test actions
    is useful when dealing with different test environments such as different operating systems for instance.</para>
